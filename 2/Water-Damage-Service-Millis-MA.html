<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth discovering.
