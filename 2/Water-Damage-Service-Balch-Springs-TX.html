<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the method and likewise were extremely valuable in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.
