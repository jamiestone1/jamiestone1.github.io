<p>Since typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and ought to be eliminated. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls.
