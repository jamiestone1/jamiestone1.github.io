Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very courteous and easy-going individual.</p>
