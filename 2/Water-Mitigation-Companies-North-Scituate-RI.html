This removes the possibility that the phone will short circuit, and need to be repaired. As you can see, time is of the essence when dealing with a water damage event.<p>
<p>Furthermore, although ammonia can kill surface area mold, dead mold and dead mold spores are still allergenic so you will need to make certain to eliminate them afterwards. A more likely scenario, sadly, is that your iPhone was turned on, or in sleep mode, when you dropped it in the beverage. So you're looking at 2 uninviting choices: power down (but in the process cause the screen and operating system to get up briefly prior to turning off) or leave the device in sleep mode and hope you do not get any notifications.<p>
