Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the location of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
