<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of property damage that a household or company can experience. When MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
