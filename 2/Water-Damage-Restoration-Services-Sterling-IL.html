Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season.
