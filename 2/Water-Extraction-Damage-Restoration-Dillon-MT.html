<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
