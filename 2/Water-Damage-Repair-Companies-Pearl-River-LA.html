The nasty odor resembles the fragrance of damp, musty laundry. Sadly, it's not uncommon for house owners to mistake mold growth for dirt.</p>
<p>Crawl areas frequently grow mold for the same reasons as basements do-they tend to stay wet long-lasting. They're smaller sized than basements, nevertheless, and typically have more ventilation, so they do not tend to have as large a mold growth area, making common expenses closer to $500 for remediation.
