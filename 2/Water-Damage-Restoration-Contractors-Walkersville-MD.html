<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he discovered just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leakage started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and then even assisted me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>
