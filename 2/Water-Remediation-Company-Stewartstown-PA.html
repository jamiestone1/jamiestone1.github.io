<p>Current Evaluation: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and carried away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
