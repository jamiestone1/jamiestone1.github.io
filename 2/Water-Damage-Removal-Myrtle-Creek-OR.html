<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
