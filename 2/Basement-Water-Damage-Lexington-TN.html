<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.

Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the professional will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
