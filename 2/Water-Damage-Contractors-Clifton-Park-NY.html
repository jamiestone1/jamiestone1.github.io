<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
