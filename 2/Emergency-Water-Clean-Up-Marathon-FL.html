They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job correctly.
