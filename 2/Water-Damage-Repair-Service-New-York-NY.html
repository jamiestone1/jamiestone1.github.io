<p>Mold can be found nearly anywhere you turn. They grow on virtually any natural substance as long as moisture and oxygen exist. Mold can grow on wood, paper, carpet, foods, and insulation. When excessive moisture accumulates in your house or office mold growth will frequently occur, especially if the moisture problem stays unaddressed or undiscovered.

As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to replace the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product ought to be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or up to the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
