<p>You wish to attend to bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded bathroom healing. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the moistened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, wipe the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
