<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the area of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Very polite and easy-going individual.</p>
