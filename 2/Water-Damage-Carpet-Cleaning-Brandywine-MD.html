There are no health or exposure-based standards that you can use to assess a mold sampling result.

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning!
