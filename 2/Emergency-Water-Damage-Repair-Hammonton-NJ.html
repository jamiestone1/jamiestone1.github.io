<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of home damage that a family or service can experience. Once MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this corrosion procedure is not stopped.</p>
