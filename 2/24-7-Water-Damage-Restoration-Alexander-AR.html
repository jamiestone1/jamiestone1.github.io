<p>Because common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
