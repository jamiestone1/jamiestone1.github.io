<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repairs. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is necessary to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
