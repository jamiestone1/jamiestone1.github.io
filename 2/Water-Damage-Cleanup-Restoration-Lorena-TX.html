It is the steady and sluggish wear and tear of products (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical energy, oxygen, water and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically known as rust). There is no reliable timetable for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal components normally start corroding right away after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can operate generally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent sign of an issue.
