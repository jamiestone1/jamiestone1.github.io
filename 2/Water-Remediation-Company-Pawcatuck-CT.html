As soon as MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a power source offered, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this deterioration procedure is not stopped.</p>
