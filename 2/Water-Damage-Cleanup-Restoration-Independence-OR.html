<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to droop before drying out, repairing it might just require pressing it back into location, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
