Although detergent itself does not kill mold, if the mold is on non-porous materials then the solution doesn't need to eliminate it as long as you entirely clean away all the mold on the surface area. Utilizing a pump sprayer, mist the surfaces with water to control the spread of spores, and roll up the areas. Double-wrap them in. 6-mm plastic and tape them with duct tape for disposal.<p>
