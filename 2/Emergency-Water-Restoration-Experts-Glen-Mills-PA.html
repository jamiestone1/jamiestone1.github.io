<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also in some cases referred to as mildew, is a fungal growth that establishes on wet products. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; inside, mold growth should be avoided. Mold reproduce by methods of tiny spores. The spores are like seeds, however undetectable to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surface areas. When the temperature level, wetness, and available nutrient conditions are correct, the spores can form into new mold colonies where they are deposited. 1 There are lots of kinds of mold, but all require moisture and a food source for development.</p>
