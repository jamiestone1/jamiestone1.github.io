<h3>Fire Restoration in Land O Lakes - Fix Your Smoke and Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health risk and should be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the pointer of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
