<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>

If you have no experience with the circumstance, a flooded home is not something that you can repair yourself. Call a water damage restoration company that can totally examine the level of the damage, and can use the very best course of action.

Use a fabric to clean down the parts inside if you can get rid of the back panel of your phone.<p>
<p>Do not attempt or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furniture, drapes or other household textile items. Those cleaning actions will only smear soot into the material, making cleaning more difficult. Use a dry, absorbent fabric to clean down the phone.
