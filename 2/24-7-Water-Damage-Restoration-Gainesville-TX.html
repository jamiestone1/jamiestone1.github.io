An automatic shut-off valve is outstanding insurance to have in any scenario, especially when the hot water heater system is located inside the home.

The perpetrator might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve requiring changing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>

Each of these needs different tools and techniques to eliminate or repair the damage.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and carried away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
