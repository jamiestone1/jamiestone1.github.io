<p>Mold likes to grow in your house's attic and crawl spaces, however what brought the mold in the very first place? The brief answer: darkness and the existence of wetness in the environment. Stone floorings require less time to change than water damaged hardwood floors. A complete floor replacement can be expected to be finished in 4 to 10 days. Water damaged walls typically peel and may need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs several hours.<p>
<p>Do not presume your property owners insurance will pay to fix your mold issues. Insurance coverage normally pays if the problem arises from an emergency already covered on your policy, like a burst pipe, but not if mold arised from delayed maintenance, persistent moisture or seepage, or from floodwaters (unless you have flood insurance). If you experience water damage, it is very important NOT to take a knee jerk response. It's best to call your insurer right away.
