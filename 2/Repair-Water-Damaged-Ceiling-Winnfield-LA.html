<p>Mold likes to grow in your house's attic and crawl spaces, however what brought the mold in the very first place? The brief answer: darkness and the existence of wetness in the environment. Stone floorings require less time to change than water damaged hardwood floors. A complete floor replacement can be expected to be finished in 4 to 10 days. Water damaged walls typically peel and may need both repair and repainting; the latter service needs several hours.<p>
<p>Do not presume your property owners insurance will pay to fix your mold issues. Insurance coverage normally pays if the problem arises from an emergency already covered on your policy, like a burst pipe, but not if mold arised from delayed maintenance, persistent moisture or seepage, or from floodwaters (unless you have flood insurance).
