<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Garnerville</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work. By lowering the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
