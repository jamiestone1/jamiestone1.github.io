<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Heath</h3>
<p>The window of opportunity to prevent mold growth is measured in hours, not days or weeks.

<p>Likewise, because bleach is mainly water, on porous surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily absorbed by the product. So, while you may have rubbed out or blemished the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually supplied plenty of water to grow back and perhaps spread the mold underneath the surface area. If there is a lot of mold growth, consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other assistance files are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be essential.<p>
