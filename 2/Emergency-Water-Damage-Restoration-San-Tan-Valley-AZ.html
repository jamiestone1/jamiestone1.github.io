<p>Learn how to eliminate black mold safely and successfully. Burst or broken pipes can be a significant headache when you have water damage and aren't sure right away from where the source of damage is originating from. Sprinkler line pipeline burst typically goes undetected until the water comes rushing through basement window wells and walls triggering significant basement water damage. A pipe burst in the attic can cause gallons of water raining down on the rooms inside your home.</p>
<p>When decontaminating a crawl space or attic, we initially check for any security risks, following OSHA and COIT guidelines for restricted area entry. We then draw out standing water using our truck-mounted extraction devices. If your insulation has actually been impacted, we will eliminate the damaged insulation, bag it up, and securely deal with it. We will also inspect vapor barriers (a sheet or coating that avoids water vapor from penetrating walls) and eliminate them if they have been damaged.</p>
