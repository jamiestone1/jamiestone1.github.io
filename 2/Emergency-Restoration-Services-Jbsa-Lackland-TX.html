<p>It's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate up to 18 inches of drywall due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a severe health risk. Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be gotten rid of to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material should be eliminated to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying given that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
