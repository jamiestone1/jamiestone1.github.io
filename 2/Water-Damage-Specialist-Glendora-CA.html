<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold development. Use a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore protection, and cover legs, hands and arms to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove visible mold. If the moldy location is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will lower the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, utilize industrial black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to sanitize the musty locations, in addition to any adjacent locations. Make sure it will not discolor the material or surface area if you use bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a neighboring exit instead of the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
