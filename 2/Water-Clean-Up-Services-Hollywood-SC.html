<h2>Tips For Effective Water Damage Restoration in Hollywood</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually facilitates mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
