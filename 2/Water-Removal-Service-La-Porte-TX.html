<p>Specific areas of your home such as crawl attics, basements and areas are a lot more prone to water damage. Dark, damp crawl areas can be a haven for mold and mildew, which is turn can then trigger structural damage as they thrive. If there is wetness leaking through it, the concrete structure of your home can trigger dripping in the basement. Condensation in the area between the attic and your home can cause moisture on the underside of the roof, which can result in mold and decomposing. When checking your home for potential reasons for water damage be sure to look out for wetness in lights as well as the overall condition of any obvious piping.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one unit for every two to three rooms, depending on the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it passes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and certified to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which implies that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout several days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
