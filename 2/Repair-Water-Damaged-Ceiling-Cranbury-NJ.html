<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold experts normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush till the mold vanishes. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to wash it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such materials take in water quickly.
