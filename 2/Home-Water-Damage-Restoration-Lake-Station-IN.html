<p>Remediation experts must disclose, in writing, when and how they are deviating from the ANSI standard. This includes if they do both testing and remediation, as that is considered a dispute of interest. We encourage that the conditions be examined pre- and post-remediation by an independent licensed professional which a different licensed remediation company perform the work. When not possible, the reason that should be stated (e.g. remote areas might not have both).<p>
<p>Also, because bleach is mainly water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly soaked up by the material. So, while you may have wiped off or blemished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually offered plenty of water to regrow and possibly spread out the mold beneath the surface area. If there is a lot of mold growth, speak with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ".  versions of these and other guidance documents are offered on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be essential.<p>
