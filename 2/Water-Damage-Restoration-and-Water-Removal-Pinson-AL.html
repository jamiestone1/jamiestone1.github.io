<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room. These units have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it goes through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, throughout several days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
