<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals normally advise is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush until the mold vanishes. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products take in water quickly. This could intensify the issue since as you understand - mold enjoys wet environments.<p>

Eliminating black mold is a step-by-step procedure that requires persistence, a financial investment in protective equipment and black mold removal items, and, of course, the guts to brave dark, cramped areas populated by hazardous fungus.<p>
