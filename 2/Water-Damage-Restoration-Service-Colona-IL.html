<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely destructive. When InstaScope was created, we engaged a group of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, a worldwide acknowledged expert on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was designated to confirm and evaluate the brand-new technology. Needless to say, it passed with flying colors. Together, we were able to develop a new mold-assessment system for commercial consumers that, unlike any other technique or device, can provide clinically precise, area-by-area outcomes-- and do so instantly. So when you think about all the threats of mold, InstaScope is a crucial tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your family.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the starting point for numerous major problems that can impact a building, damage personal property and present major health dangers to residents.

Additionally, they must have the ability to communicate with the water damage victims and insurer agents with self-confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the ideal breeding location for mold, while poor indoor ventilation can cause molds to flourish. Wet building products and damp indoor air are mold's best friends.</p>
