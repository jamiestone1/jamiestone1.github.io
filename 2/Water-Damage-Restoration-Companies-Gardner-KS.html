The psychrometric chart supplies us with the tools to assess which drying devices or approaches will be the most efficient. It is important to identify if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and hidden energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately forecasts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure materials and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
