<p>Jake (and his group) are incredible to work with. They fasted to respond initially and provided a fair and affordable  quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule immediately and get the work done really rapidly. Our mold concern wound up being smaller sized than first thought so the last invoice reflected the real work needed and was less than first priced estimate. Jake was very responsive to emails and calls responding to questions throughout the procedure. All in all, I had an excellent experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide eliminates mold as it is anti-fungal along with anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Hydrogen peroxide is a great option to chlorine bleach since it is safe to use and does not damage the environment, nor does it leave behind toxic residue or produce hazardous fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug stores for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>
