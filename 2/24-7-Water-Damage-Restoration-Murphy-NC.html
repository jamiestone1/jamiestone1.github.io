<p>Deterioration is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the gradual and sluggish deterioration of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you combine electricity, metal, oxygen and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more typically called rust). There is no trusted timetable for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal parts usually begin wearing away right away after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without revealing any obvious sign of an issue.
