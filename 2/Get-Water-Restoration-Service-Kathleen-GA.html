<p>Due to the fact that common building products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
