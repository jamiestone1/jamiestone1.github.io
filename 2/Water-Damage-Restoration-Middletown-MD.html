<p>Any structure that has actually struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on floorings and walls is another potential effect of water damage. Walls and flooring might require replacement or refinishing depending on the level of damage. Musty odors can stick around in a home where leakages or flooding have taken place and this could be indicative of excess mold and mildew development.</p>
