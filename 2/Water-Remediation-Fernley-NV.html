To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no requirement to rinse it off because borax will keep the mold from coming back. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products take in water quickly. This might exacerbate the issue since as you know - mold loves moist environments.<p>
