Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired instead of being completely changed. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might require fixing, if there is small damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may require replacing and in some cases even the subfloor too. The sort of wood floor covering you might have limits the type and figures out of repair work that need to happen. Solid hardwood floor covering enables a larger range of options to repair the issue.
