<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most disastrous things that can occur to an individual or a household. To limit damage to personal possessions, get rid of any items that can be transferred. This might consist of individual impacts such as clothes and accessories, as well as rugs, drapes, and soft home furnishings.

<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
