<p>You wish to address bathroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a best breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 steps get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in cautious strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
