<p>When standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
