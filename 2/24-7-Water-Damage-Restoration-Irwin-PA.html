<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a large location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
