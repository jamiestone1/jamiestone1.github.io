Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to prolonged water direct exposure and requires masonry work to repair.

Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
