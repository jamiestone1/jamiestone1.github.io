<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful person.</p>
