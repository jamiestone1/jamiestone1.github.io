<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>

<p>For the most part, an individual notices some staining on a wall or baseboard. It might look like a random, old mold stain. If there is no connection in between respiratory issues, illness, headaches, many simply overlook it. A better idea might be to think about calling a mold cleaning company for another viewpoint. After all, there may be absolutely nothing more than discoloration noticeable on the surface but what hides below might be something far worse than a stain. Cleaning the visible side of a wall surface area might not deliver true mold removal.</p>
