<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

Warm air in between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal, especially for the first 36 to two days of drying and is the ideal temperature level for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit help in the evaporation procedure. Extremely hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit hinders the dehumidifiers' effectiveness.<p>
<p>A bleach solution also works to kill mold. Mix one cup of bleach in a gallon of water, use to the surface area and do not wash.
