<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest step in the procedure is restoration. Restoration involves changing materials like drywall and insulation. Often this process is as easy as setting up a couple of panels of drywall, while serious cases could require changing entire walls. Direct exposure to poisonous compounds like lead and asbestos is possible during restoration. Older homes are likely to contain these compounds.</p>
