<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Beachwood - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is essential to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the task is ended up.<p>
