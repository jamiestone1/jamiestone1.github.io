<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier since it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth learning. As soon as the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the specialist will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to complete.<p>
<p>The first step in solving an indoor mold issue is to eliminate the wetness source; 18 new mold will begin to grow on moist, porous surfaces within 24 to 2 days.
