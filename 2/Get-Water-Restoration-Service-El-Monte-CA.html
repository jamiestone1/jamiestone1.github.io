<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Black mold can be harmful to your health, generally triggering breathing concerns. However in serious cases and for people with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can result in pneumonia. When you believe a mold intrusion, you might want to purchase a mold screening set to see what kind of mold spores you're working with, and hire an expert to aid with removal. But in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you likely already have on-hand) that will help get rid of mold.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can acquire gadgets to measure relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air circulation near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to minimize the production of moisture in the home are all very crucial in managing high humidity that often triggers mold growth in our climate.</p>

<p>Mold is practically all over, floating in the air and on all surface areas. People are exposed to molds 24 hr a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year. Direct exposures increase when indoor moldy products becomes dried, damaged or interrupted, causing spores and other mold cells to be launched into the air and after that inhaled. Raised exposure can also happen if people directly deal with moldy products or mistakenly consume mold.</p>
<p>If you pick to hire a professional (or other expert company) to do the cleanup, make certain the contractor has experience cleaning up mold. Inspect recommendations and ask the contractor to follow the recommendations in EPA's" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures, the standards of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the Guidelines of the New York City City Department of Health and Mental Health (NYCDOHMM), the industry standards published by the Institute of Evaluation, Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC) or other applicable standards from industry, expert or government organizations.</p>

<p>Likewise, given that bleach is mostly water, on permeable surfaces, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is easily taken in by the product. So, while you may have rubbed out or tarnished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've actually offered plenty of water to regrow and possibly spread the mold underneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold development, consult the U.S. Epa's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  variations of these and other assistance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold web page If the musty material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement might be needed.<p>
