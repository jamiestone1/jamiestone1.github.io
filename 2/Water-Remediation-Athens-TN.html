<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of home damage that a household or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to move throughout the board. You will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>
