<p>If smoke and fire damage has impacted your valuables, we will work with you and your insurance company to determine what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be restored, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged possessions.

Basically, it makes the location strong once again and protects the surface from future water damage. After you have used the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
