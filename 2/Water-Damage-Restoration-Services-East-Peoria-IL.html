Warm air between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal, especially for the very first 36 to 2 days of drying and is the optimal temperature level for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation procedure. Overly hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit hampers the dehumidifiers' efficiency.<p>
<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead organic product such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic products such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs moisture, although some mold species can acquire that moisture from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards away from walls so that you can check sheetrock at floor level. The permeable material can quickly take in flood water, and you need to know the extent of prospective damage.<p>
