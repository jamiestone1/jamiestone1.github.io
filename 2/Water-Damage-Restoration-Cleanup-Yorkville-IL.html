The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying devices or approaches will be the most efficient. It is vital to identify if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and hidden energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
