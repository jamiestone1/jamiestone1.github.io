<p>Mold spores are found nearly all over, both indoors and out. If water or really high levels 1 of humidity exist in your home, mold growth can begin in as low as 48 hours.

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of numerous days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating procedures.</p>
