<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
