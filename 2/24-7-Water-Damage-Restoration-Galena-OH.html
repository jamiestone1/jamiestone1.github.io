<p>HVAC: Heating system and a/c unit units can end up being flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot burner. They can also end up being muddy, and cleaning them will need expert cleaning. In addition, venting systems can flood and end up being polluted. If that occurs, they should be taken apart and hosed off piece by piece to avoid contamination from being blown through the air.</p>

It's not always easy to determine when water damage is and isn't covered by your policy, but keep reading for more detail on whether you're covered.</p>

Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying since the leakage began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Extremely respectful and easy-going person.</p>
