<p>Rust is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and slow deterioration of materials (generally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you combine electrical power, oxygen, water and metal, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly called rust). There is no dependable timetable for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal elements generally start wearing away right away after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can function generally for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of a problem. How quick the deterioration process takes depends on a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the intensity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
