<p>Any building that has actually struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at danger of mold growth. There is an excellent video below that I encourage you to watch. We came across it while helping a reader with a Recreational Vehicle water damage repair. Not only does it do an excellent task of revealing you the damage that water can do to a Recreational Vehicle, the creator also demonstrates how to repair the damage step by action. Now this repair was performed in 2011 to a Fleetwood Burglar 275N Fifth-wheel travel trailer, however the concepts still use even if you have a motorhome or fiberglass exterior.</p>
<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
