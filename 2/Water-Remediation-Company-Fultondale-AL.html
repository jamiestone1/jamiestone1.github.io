<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air motion throughout damp surface areas of assemblies or products is a crucial part of efficiently and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or products. Fast air motion across the surface of material ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area wetness paves the way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation products. The consistent and falling rates of drying products require different criteria for changing conditions.</p>

<p>Mold in the basement can be consistent, given the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and normally have poor ventilation and little air flow, a mix that can trigger mold to thrive. And obviously, basements can be susceptible to flooding, due to extreme weather or unnoticed leakages in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, once mold develops, cinder block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep photos of the water damage and all files connected with the damage and your claim in case mold grows in the future. Your insurer might be reluctant to agree that any potential mold is the result of prior water damage, however having records and pictures will serve as valuable proof of your claim. If the mold is deemed to have come from water damage, some insurance providers may make you file a second claim of water damage instead, needing you to pay another deductible prior to remediation occurs.</p>
