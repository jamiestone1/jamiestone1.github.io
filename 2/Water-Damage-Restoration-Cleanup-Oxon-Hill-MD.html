Look for noticeable mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or tough and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
