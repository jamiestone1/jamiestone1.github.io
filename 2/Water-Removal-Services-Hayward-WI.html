<p>When a home suffers a water damage event in Washington, DC, a mold infestation can rapidly spread and arise throughout a home in 48-72 hours.

If you believe that your Washington home or service has a mold issue, SERVPRO of Washington, DC can inspect, assess and remediate your home.</p>
<p>Mold is a major-league nuisance. It blackens the grout lines in your shower, tarnishes drywall, shows up as black spots on siding, darkens decks, and grows on and decomposes damp wood all over. Even worse, it can be bad for your health. Mold releases tiny spores that cause allergic reactions, runny noses and sneezing, as well as even damaging and annoying odors. We'll cover how to get rid of mold, how to eliminate black mold, how to kill mold on wood and what kills mold in a few steps.</p>
<h3>Tips to Recover From Fires Caused by Flooding in Hayward</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and must be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
<p>Damaged materials should be eliminated quickly with proper safety devices worn by experts. The EPA recommends flood cleanup efforts be carried out within two days. We live and work in this community too; we may even be neighbors.
