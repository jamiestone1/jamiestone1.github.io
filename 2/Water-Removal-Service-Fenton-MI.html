<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or organisation is among the most devastating things that can take place to a person or a family. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired instead of being completely changed. Then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may need repairing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may require changing and in some cases even the subfloor as well. The type of wood flooring you may have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Solid hardwood flooring permits a broader series of alternatives to repair the issue. With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual slabs. The best way to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
