<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the place of the leak for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and really courteous person.</p>
