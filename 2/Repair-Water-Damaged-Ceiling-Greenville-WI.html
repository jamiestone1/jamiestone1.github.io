<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Greenville</h3>
<p>I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Extremely courteous and easy-going individual.<p>
