<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted sprawling suburban houses, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Characteristics built with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local firms. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>
<p>In the course of a remediation, we occasionally recommend disposing of specific types of things and surface areas. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all common items in need of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup process, which likewise includes sweeping and vacuuming up any dirt or small particles overlooked in the remediation process. A special HEPA vacuum ensures that even small particles get gathered to lessen the possibilities of the mold moving elsewhere. This aids in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make two times as sure that mold doesn't discover an escape of the contained work area and into a various part of the structure.</p>

<p>The most efficient method to prevent mold development on water damage is to start the drying process rapidly.

Studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing air-borne mold or surface area mold contamination.
