<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, attempt to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the rest of the year.

<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are fantastic for drying in difficult to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more effective when drying under carpet and padding. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout damp surfaces, vaporizing moisture into the air. With using warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient number of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>

<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We typically will set one system for each 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the intake where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, throughout a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
