They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the way and also were really valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
