<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Our experience with RestorePro was fantastic. I would 100% recommend calling them for aid. When we found our water leakage upstairs their mitigation team was here in no time (on a Friday night). Phillip was professional, friendly and helped me understand the procedure of what would be taking place to fix and repair our home. I might inform each and every staff member I satisfied was selected because of their professionalism and attention to detail. The completed item was beyond our expectations. I'm really fussy about the work that is performed in my home, observe all the information and was impressed with the completed outcome. Their team dealt with quickly with our insurance. When I told my representative who we called she stated Oh, you're in excellent hands, they're excellent!" I could not agree more. Thank you for the work you carried out in our home.

<p>Remove the device from the water as rapidly as possible, and get rid of the battery instantly. Removing the battery quickly might make the distinction to conserve your phone. Most phones have a white indicator near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has actually damaged the gadget. You can attempt to draw the moisture out by immersing the phone in a bowl of rice or other absorbent product overnight. You can also try to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you do not hold the vacuum too close to the gadget. Sometimes cleaning the phone with rubbing alcohol will work if it has not been exposed to water very long.</p>

<p>Recent Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying considering that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even assisted me closed down my main water valve. Really polite and easy-going person.</p>
