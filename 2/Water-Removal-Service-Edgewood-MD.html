Part of our tracking procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air.

We ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
