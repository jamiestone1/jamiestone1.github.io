<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier gets rid of water vapor from the air utilizing a process called condensation.

<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health risk and need to be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
