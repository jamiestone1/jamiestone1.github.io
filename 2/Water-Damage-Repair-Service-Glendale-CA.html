Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a moist towel. Just like a few of the above approaches, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and transported away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to get the job done correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>

After getting rid of all infected and damp products, contact somebody who can examine your home and begin the restoration process.<p>
