It can be a long-term health hazard and ought to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater.

This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
