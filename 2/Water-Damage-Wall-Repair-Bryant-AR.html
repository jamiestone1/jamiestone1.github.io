<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and progressive wear and tear of products (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust occurs when you combine electricity, metal, oxygen and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more commonly referred to as rust). There is no trustworthy timetable for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal components typically start rusting instantly after the spill, but sometimes your Mac can function normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem. How quickly the rust process takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of corrosion brought on by a water spill.</p>
