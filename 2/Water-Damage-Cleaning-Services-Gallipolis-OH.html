<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals think that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion happens, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

If the company charges a per hour rate for water damage restoration services, the charge is around $75 per hour. Special circumstances, such as particles removal, increase the typical labor rate with surcharges of $200 or more.</p>
