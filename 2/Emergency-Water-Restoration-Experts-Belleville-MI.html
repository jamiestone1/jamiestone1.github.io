<h3>Fire And Water Restoration in Belleville</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health danger and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were really happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
