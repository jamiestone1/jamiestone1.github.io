<p>Find out how to eliminate black mold safely and efficiently. When you have water damage and aren't sure instantly from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or broken pipes can be a major headache.

<p>Due to the fact that mold spores are tiny, merely cleaning the areas that you can see is frequently insufficient to deal with the issue.
