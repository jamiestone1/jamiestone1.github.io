<p>Current Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he learnt how much water costs I was paying because the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & discovered of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve.
