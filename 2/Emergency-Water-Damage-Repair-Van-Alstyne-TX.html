<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is moist and good, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that common structure products can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
