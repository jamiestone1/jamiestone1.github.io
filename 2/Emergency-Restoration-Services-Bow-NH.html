<p>Water damage is among the primary causes of mold growing on the walls and ceilings of a home. Any sign of excessive moisture, moldy smells or mold need to be taken on as soon as possible to prevent further complications that may cause health problems and serious damage to your home. Mold assessments are typically beneficial to detect any type of mold growing in your home, particularly those that might impact your health negatively.</p>
<p>Damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches might require a complete replacement panel installed because big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out. For example, if the space where you removed the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to secure a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to change the whole drywall panel.</p>
