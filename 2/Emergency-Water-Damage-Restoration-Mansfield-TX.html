<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
