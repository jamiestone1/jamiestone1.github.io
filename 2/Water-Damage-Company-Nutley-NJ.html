Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
