<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Morro Bay</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and should be gotten rid of. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
