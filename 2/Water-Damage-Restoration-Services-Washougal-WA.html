Never scrape dried mold, otherwise the hazardous spores could spread into air and trigger negative health impacts.</p>
<p>Damaged areas larger than 12 square inches may require a total replacement panel installed due to the fact that big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out. For example, if the space where you eliminated the damaged drywall exposes joists or studs where it will be possible to protect a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might need to change the whole drywall panel.</p>
