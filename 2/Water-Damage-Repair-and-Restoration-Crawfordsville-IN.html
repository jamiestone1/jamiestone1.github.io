<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Crawfordsville</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repairs. By reducing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
