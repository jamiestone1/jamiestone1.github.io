<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out just how much water costs I was paying given that the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and really polite individual.</p>
