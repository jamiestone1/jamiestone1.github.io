<p>After you've cleaned up sufficiently, dry the surface areas with a clean rag. You might utilize fans to speed this procedure up. You probably still odor smoke smells, which can take a few days to a few weeks to dissipate. Look around the room, and recognize products that can quickly take in smell. You can put these items together in a separate space or outdoors to see if the smell dissipates after a few days; think about throwing away the items you can stand to part with. Getting your carpets professionally steam-cleamed can also help with sticking around smoke smells - very same goes with any upholstery, furniture or curtains. Having these cleaned professionally will significantly minimize the smoke smell.<p>
