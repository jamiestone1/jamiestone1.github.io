With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for specific slabs. The very best way to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to change the afflicted boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
