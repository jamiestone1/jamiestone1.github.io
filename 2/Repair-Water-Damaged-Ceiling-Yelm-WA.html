Before mold is located, you may smell a distinct moldy aroma or experience allergy signs due to mold exposure. These odors are specifically pungent in locations like the basement. The nasty odor is similar to the aroma of wet, mildewy laundry. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for homeowners to mistake mold development for dirt.</p>
