Part of our tracking procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days.
