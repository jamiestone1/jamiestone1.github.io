<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
