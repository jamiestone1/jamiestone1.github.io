<h3>Fire Damage Claims in West Sacramento - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health risk and must be removed if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
<p>Temperature Control - Through this last step we apply the principles of psychrometry, making sure that all wetness as soon as eliminated is not put back into the structure, hence lowering the opportunity of mold and mildew development.
