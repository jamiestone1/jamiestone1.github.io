<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can provide your living room a sense of warmth and convenience even when there's no fire, however a weathered and cracked chimney can typically allow rain throughout the cooler months which can seep through the walls. In time, moisture from the water can trigger the paint on the wall to bubble, flake and peel. Water damage can turn your cosy little living room into an unloved and exhausted  area.<p>
<p>Different types of expense factors considerably play into just how much any water damage repair work in your home will cost.
