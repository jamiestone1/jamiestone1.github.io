<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
