<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is among the most devastating things that can occur to a household or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor might be fixed rather than being fully replaced. If there is small damage then most of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard might require repairing. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the entire floor may require replacing and often even the subfloor as well. The type of wood flooring you might have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Strong hardwood floor covering allows for a broader variety of options to repair the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away approximately a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface. This type of flooring can also have replacements for individual slabs. The very best method to look after a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the affected boards and after that refinish the entire floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
<p>Water damage arises from damaged pipes, obstructed drains pipes, malfunctioning devices, storms, fire damage, and other causes. The appropriate treatment depends on the nature of the damage.

Even clean water can create mildew and other bacterial development if overlooked.</p>
