Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my primary water valve.
