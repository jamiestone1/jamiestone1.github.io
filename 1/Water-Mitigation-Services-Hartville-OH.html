Desiccant dehumidifiers absorb moisture through chemical attraction instead of condensation to eliminate water from the air. A desiccant is a product that holds and attracts moisture. This material imitates a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel turns through warmed exhaust air, the wetness vaporizes (desorption) and is carried outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings need to be included in the drying record to include equipment, air, and a/c systems. Wetness content levels for damp structural products should be recorded in a wetness content spreadsheet to reveal the progress of drying These taped wetness content readings will show that the building is back to an appropriate range of pre-loss condition. It is very important to know that air records alone will not show that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if adequate dehumidification is being used or if modifications are needed.</p>
