<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health threat and should be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater.

This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
