<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As discussed, fast air motion across wet surface areas of assemblies or products is a critical element of efficiently and effectively drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Fast air motion across the surface of product ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface wetness gives way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation products. The consistent and falling rates of drying materials require various requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>Amongst the items we use to resolve mold concerns is the resurfacing agent Microbe Guard, which produces a new, long-term layer over a surface.

A cornerstone of our approach to mold remediation is extensive avoidance that obstructs the regrowth of hazardous mold.
