Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can cause interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
