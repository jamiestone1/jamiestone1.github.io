<p>Water invasion into buildings can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his men were remarkable in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and change the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without doubt.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your services on our floor issue. When I say we were very pleased with your company's service, I speak for both myself and Dale. It was excellent that you were accessible when we needed you. I also wish to applaud you on your perseverance. You handled the difficulties of insurance coverage timelines wonderfully.

I never ever felt anything less than professionalism and high-quality work. I would highly recommend you and your company to anyone. I can't thank you enough for your assistance.</p>

<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some artificial products such as adhesives and paints. Mold requires moisture, although some mold types can acquire that wetness from wet air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can examine sheetrock at floor level. The porous material can quickly absorb flood water, and you need to know the degree of possible damage.<p>
