<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve browsing a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
