<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences.

Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and good, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
