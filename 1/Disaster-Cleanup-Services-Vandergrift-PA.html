<p>Due to the fact that common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or moisture exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
