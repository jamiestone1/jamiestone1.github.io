When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other parts.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion procedure. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this rust procedure is not stopped, you will likely end up with an extremely expensive paperweight.</p>
