<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the place the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
