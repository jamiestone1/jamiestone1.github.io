They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job correctly.
