As mold and water damage professionals, we have the expertise, the experience, and the state-of-the-art training that allows our group of professionals to get your residential or commercial property brought back in a time efficient way. Getting our clients back into their houses in a safe environment is our # 1 concern.<p>
<p>Eliminating among the 3 requirements for mold reduces (or gets rid of) brand-new mold development: wetness; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat since mold generally does not grow in cold environments. I had a terrific experience working with the team at Northwest Water and Fire Restoration. They were expert, punctual and extremely communicative! I would absolutely recommend for any mitigation or restoration work you need.<p>
<p>Mold discovered in residential homes can lead to breathing problems, long-lasting health problem, and even death. Though these conditions are rare, it is not a danger worth taking. If you identify even the smallest sign of mold in your house - whether in the attic, basement, or somewhere else - contact Restoration 1. We provide immediate mold remediation services for house owners throughout the country. To change the whole sheet, eliminate the damaged drywall totally, to the studs. Remove the drywall screws that anchored the old sheet to the studs using a power drill. If there was a lot of water damage, this need to be relatively easy; the old drywall will most likely collapse away.<p>
<p>Now that your surface area is clean, protected from future water damage and primed, you are ready to paint and give some much needed colour to your wall. In the above video, we used Berger Everlast on the walls with Dulux Snow Season Quarter for colour. On the architraves, we used Berger Water-based Enamel in Gloss and left this untinted white. Upon arrival, our water damage specialists will carry out an extensive assessment of your residential or commercial property, which includes moisture metering and usage of infrared cams to figure out the extent of the damage.<p>
