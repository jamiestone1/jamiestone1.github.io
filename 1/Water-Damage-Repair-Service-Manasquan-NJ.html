<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living-room and carried away everything else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job appropriately.
