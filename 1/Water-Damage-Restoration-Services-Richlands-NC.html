<p>Mold can cause major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
