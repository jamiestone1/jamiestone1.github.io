<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Warminster</h3>
<p>When you are planning large repair work, bear in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By reducing the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
