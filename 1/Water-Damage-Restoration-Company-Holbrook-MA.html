<p>Flood damage cleanup for wood floors should be dried slowly. Sudden drying might trigger cracking or splitting. Some restoration companies can speed up drying time by requiring air through the fluted underside of hardwood floorboards. Remove hardwood floor boards to prevent buckling. Get rid of a board every couple of feet to decrease buckling brought on by swelling. Clean and dry wood before trying repairs.<p>
<p>A portable dehumidifier can eliminate water vapor from the air in an included area, like a bedroom or downstairs rec space. Shut the room's doors and windows to prevent more humidity from permeating in. Buy a big dehumidifier ($ 270) so you do not have to clear its water drawer regularly. First things first. Get the iPhone out of the water right now, if you haven't currently. And do not even think about plugging it in.<p>
