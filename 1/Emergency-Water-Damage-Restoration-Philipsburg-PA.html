<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance to have in any scenario, especially when the hot water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater is imminent unless fixed quickly, and the costs go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit may have been something as basic as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something catastrophic like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Cleaning of all afflicted surfaces starts next. Antifungal and antimicrobial cleansers are used on any tough surface areas to eliminate the mold from the surface. If anything can be eliminated, such as furniture, clothes, or toys, these are typically brought offsite for cleaning to make certain all mold spores are gotten rid of, usually including deep cleaning with an antimicrobial or antifungal cleanser.</p>
