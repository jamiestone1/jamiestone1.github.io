<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve browsing a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
