<p>When standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature level too, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any changes if you have questions on this.</p>
<p>It is mainly standing water that triggers mold development. It can seep into porous surfaces, and those products can end up being reproducing grounds for harmful molds and fungi.

<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a long-term health danger and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize just the tip of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
