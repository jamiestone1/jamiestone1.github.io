<p>Smoke damage is a typical side effect of fire damage, but it can take place on its own if a fire is contained. It is your obligation to pay the deductible if you make a claim with your provider. It is customary for restoration contractors to collect the deductible up front when work is to start, and we will inform your insurance provider in such instances. Other times, your deductible might be subtracted" from the final insurance check, in which case you would pay the deductible amount at the end of the task. Another possibility is that your insurance coverage carrier take the deductible amount off of the amount they owe you for your personal contents. In all these cases, you eventually pay your deductible, either to Flagship or in another way.</p>
<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or wetness direct exposure and may be caused by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
