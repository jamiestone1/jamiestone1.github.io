There might be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air.
