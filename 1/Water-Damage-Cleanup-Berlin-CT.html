<p>To get wetness out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many individuals swear by raw rice, recommending owners to put their wet iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the stuff (cover it entirely) and leave it there for two days or two. A: Mold is a tiny fungus that belongs to the natural environment and required for our ecosystem. While it is needed in the outside world, excessive mold inside a structure can be unsanitary and hazardous. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores float through the air both inside and outside.<p>
