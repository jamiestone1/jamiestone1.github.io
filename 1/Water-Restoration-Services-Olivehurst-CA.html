When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements.

This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually rusting. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure.
