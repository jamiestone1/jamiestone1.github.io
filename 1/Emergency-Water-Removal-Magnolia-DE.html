While a typical cause of residential water damage is typically the failure of a sump pump, lots of property owner's insurance policies do not cover the associated costs without an addendum which contributes to the regular monthly premium of the policy. Typically the terminology of this addendum resembles "Drain Pipes and sewer Coverage".</p>
