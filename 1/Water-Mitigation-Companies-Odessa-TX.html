<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his guys were remarkable in assisting us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and also were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
