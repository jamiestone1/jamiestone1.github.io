<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a hazardous scenario for property owners, according to Pipes 2.0's veteran pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may cause a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and lack of sanitation until the system is fixed. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewer system can not function appropriately (typical plumbing issues in old houses ).
