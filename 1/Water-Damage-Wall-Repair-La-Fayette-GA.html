<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The most effective water damage restoration jobs begin with a thorough extraction; our exclusive extraction equipment will start things off on the ideal foot. We will then provide you with a drying strategy and the correct equipment to finish the process. We invest heavily in the most updated drying devices to manage the drying procedure.
