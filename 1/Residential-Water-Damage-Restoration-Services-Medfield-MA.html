<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely destructive. Jake and his guys were incredible in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (frequently twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and likewise were very practical in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
