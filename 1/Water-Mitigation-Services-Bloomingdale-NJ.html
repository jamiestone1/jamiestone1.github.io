What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inadequate against eliminating mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
