<p>Flooding can trigger major damage to a commercial building. Whether it's triggered by heavy rain, overruning waterways, or damaged pipes, the water must be eliminated and the structure's contents should be quickly dried to prevent structural damage, mold growth, and other issues. When there is lots of moisture from a leaking roofing system, high humidity, or flood, the mold grows best. There is no way to get rid of all molds and mold spores from your home. But you can control mold growth by keeping your home dry.<p>

We can hinder this damage with a thorough examination of the residential or commercial property, and a proper strategy on how to completely dry it out.

Whether you hire Allphase Restoration and Construction or do it yourself, you can lessen additional damage by following these guidelines.<p>
<p>Fusarium: this is another fast-spreading mold that can be discovered on all surfaces, even at low temperatures.
