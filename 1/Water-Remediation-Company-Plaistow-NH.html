<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying equipment or techniques will be the most efficient. It is vital to figure out if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outside temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in identifying what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, reasonable and latent energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely forecasts the energy evaluation of ambient air and its relationship to several building products and how they react to each one and offer the very best evaporation results. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more valuable if the outdoors grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>

Nevertheless, FEMA suggests that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with full sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 8 feet or as much as the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
