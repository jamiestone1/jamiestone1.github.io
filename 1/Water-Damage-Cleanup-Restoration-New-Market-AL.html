<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown inefficient against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Because common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
