<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or materials; mold can also obtain nutrients from some artificial products such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs wetness, although some mold species can obtain that wetness from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Thoroughly pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level.
