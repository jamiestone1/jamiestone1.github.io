<p>Since common structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
