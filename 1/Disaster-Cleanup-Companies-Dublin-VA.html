<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a wide location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

One product we utilize is MMR, an industrial grade tool that gets deep underneath the external layer to destroy mold. In addition, we deal with the spots in some cases brought on by a mold growth.

Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outside air can likewise set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
