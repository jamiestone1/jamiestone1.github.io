<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people think that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include browsing a broad location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>

Standard family fans are not efficient in moving an adequate amount of air required to dry a space effectively.</p>
