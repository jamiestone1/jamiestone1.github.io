<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of property damage that a family or business can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and gradually corroding. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This triggers the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely pricey paperweight.</p>
