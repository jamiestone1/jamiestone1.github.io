<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for visible mold growth (it may look cottony, velvety, rough, or leatherlike and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often looks like a staining or fuzzy growth on furnishings or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made of wood or paper). Try to find indications of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, and so on).</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings must be included in the drying record to include heating and cooling, devices, and air systems. Moisture content levels for wet structural materials should be tape-recorded in a moisture material spreadsheet to reveal the progress of drying These recorded wetness content readings will reveal that the structure is back to an appropriate series of pre-loss condition. It is necessary to know that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if enough dehumidification is being utilized or if modifications are needed.</p>
