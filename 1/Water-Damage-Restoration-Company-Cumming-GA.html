Did you know that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does.

And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will include searching a broad location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
