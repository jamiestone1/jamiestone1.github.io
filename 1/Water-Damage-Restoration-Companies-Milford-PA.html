<p>Fire Damage is the most disastrous sort of property damage that a household or service can experience. When MacBook water damage has occurred, the liquid will likely make its way to the reasoning board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this corrosion process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
