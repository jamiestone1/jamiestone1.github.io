<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying project back days.

<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for every 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space.

These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout numerous days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
