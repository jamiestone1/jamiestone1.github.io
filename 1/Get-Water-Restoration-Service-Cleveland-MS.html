<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
