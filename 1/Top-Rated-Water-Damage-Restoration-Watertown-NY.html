Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak began, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
