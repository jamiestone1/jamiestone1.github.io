<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. During a water loss emergency, almost every location of your Seattle home could be at threat for damage. Moving water and moisture can permeate permeable surfaces and contents, which can change their look and trigger irreparable damage within the very first two days of exposure. It is vital for restoration and healing efforts to start as soon as possible to better protect these impacted locations and items in your house.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
