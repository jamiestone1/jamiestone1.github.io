<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
