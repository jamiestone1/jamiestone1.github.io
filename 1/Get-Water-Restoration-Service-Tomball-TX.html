<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to the house and began drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (often twice a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.
