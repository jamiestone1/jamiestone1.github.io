Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess wetness within the assemblies or products. Quick air movement throughout the surface area of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area wetness gives way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products need different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
