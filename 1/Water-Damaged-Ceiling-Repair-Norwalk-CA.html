<h2>Main Causes of Home Water Damage in Norwalk</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that involves a considerable amount of water absorption into low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, developed assemblies). Drying might need unique methods, longer drying times, or substantial water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
