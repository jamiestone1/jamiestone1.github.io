Erosion to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and needs masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on walls and floorings is another prospective impact of water damage. Walls and flooring may need replacement or refinishing depending on the degree of damage. Moldy smells can linger in a home where leakages or flooding have occurred and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>The best remediation is done by a mold assessor who verifies the existence of a mold problem requiring action and the extent of damage then writes a clear scope of work consisting of suitable standards. This file must clearly explain the actions that will be followed by the remediation specialist, for example how the affected location will be included or what the confirmation criteria are.
