<p>Any structure that has actually suffered from water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold growth. There is a great video below that I motivate you to watch. We came across it while assisting a reader with a Recreational Vehicle water damage repair. Not only does it do a fantastic job of revealing you the damage that water can do to a RV, the creator also shows how to repair the damage step by action. Now this repair was done in 2011 to a Fleetwood Burglar 275N Fifth-wheel travel trailer, however the principles still use even if you have a motorhome or fiberglass exterior.</p>

<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Fitchburg</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be an irreversible health threat and must be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
