<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the exact same method, so if the location the spores land is moist and great, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or moist. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
