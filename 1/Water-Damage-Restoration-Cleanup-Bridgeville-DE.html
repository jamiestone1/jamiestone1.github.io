<h2>Flood Restoration Tips in Bridgeville: What to Do After a Storm</h2>

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
