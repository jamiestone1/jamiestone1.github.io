Alternatively, consider cleaning clothes in cold water with your typical family laundry detergent, and adding one tablespoon of pure vanilla extract.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air.

These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
