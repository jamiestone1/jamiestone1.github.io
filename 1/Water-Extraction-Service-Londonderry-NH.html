<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is exceptional insurance coverage to have in any circumstance, especially when the hot water heater system lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your hot water heater is imminent unless repaired rapidly, and the expenses increase the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve requiring changing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>

If the mold is considered to have actually come from water damage, some insurers might make you file a second claim of water damage rather, needing you to pay another deductible prior to remediation occurs.</p>
