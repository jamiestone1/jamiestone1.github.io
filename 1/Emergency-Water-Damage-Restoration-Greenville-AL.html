<p>Mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Because typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or wetness exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, usually condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>Sadly, however, utilizing bleach is only effective if the mold is growing on non-porous products such as tiles, bathtubs, glass and countertops. Bleach can not penetrate into permeable products therefore it does not enter contact with mold growing below the surface area of materials such as wood and drywall. Utilizing bleach on these materials will kill the mold above the surface area however the roots within the material will remain and the mold will soon return.</p>
<p>The most effective method to prevent mold growth on water damage is to start the drying process quickly. Restoration companies that are aware of possible mold growth problems typically know how to dry structural materials by decreasing the indoor humidity, judiciously move air and in some cases heat up the affected location. This is generally a reliable way to dry a building, resulting in minimized material removal and decreased mold growth.</p>
<p>Ice dams and other roofing issues can also trigger water damage to siding materials also. Here, the greatest threat is water seeping in behind your siding and causing irreversible damage to more susceptible products. So if this happens, you will need to get rid of or replace the siding rapidly before rot sets in. Water can also permeate in behind synthetic stone and other external walls around your home. So it is essential to be thorough in this inspection.</p>
