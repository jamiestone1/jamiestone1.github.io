Standing water and bulk sewage should be extracted with self-contained vacuum equipment with proper waste holding tanks which should be gotten rid of effectively. Hard surfaces that are impacted need to be cleaned and sterilized. Soft structural products such as carpets, carpet pads, plaster wallboard must be gotten rid of and effectively dealt with. Any material that takes in substantial quantities of moisture and can not be properly cleaned should be removed.
