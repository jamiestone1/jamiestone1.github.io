If it is the outcome of water damage related to a typical danger, when home insurance coverage covers mold.

<p>LGR - Low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers - This kind of dehumidifier removes water vapor from the air using a procedure called condensation.

LGR dehumidifiers use a double cooling or improved step to decrease the moisture-laden air temperature level when inside the dehumidifier so more condensation can form on the internal cooling coils.</p>
