<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land someplace. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the place the spores land is wet and great, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
