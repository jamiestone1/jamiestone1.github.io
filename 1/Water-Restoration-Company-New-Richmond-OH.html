<h3>Water Damage Leads in New Richmond Ohio</h2>
<p>Vapor pressure is directly related to humidity ratio (specific humidity or grains per pound-gpp and humidity). As heat is used to a material, energy is added. Raising the temperature level of a damp material increases the rate of evaporation, further releasing wetness from the material and changing the internal vapor pressure. The greater the difference in between ambient temperature and humidity temperature level, the greater the capacity for faster and more efficient drying.</p>
<p>When standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any changes.</p>
