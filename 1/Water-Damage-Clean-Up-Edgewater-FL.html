<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water leaking either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible signs of moisture, leaking water, or indications of failing structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might collapse or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous plaster material. Other times, you may see little indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand gradually.</p>
<p>An insurance plan might or may not cover the costs related to water damage and the process of water damage restoration.

Frequently the terminology of this addendum is similar to "Sewer and Drain Pipes Coverage".</p>
