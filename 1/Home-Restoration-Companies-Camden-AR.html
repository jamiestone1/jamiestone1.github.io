<p>Places that are typically or constantly damp can be tough to keep completely without mold. If there's some mold in the shower or somewhere else in the bathroom that seems to come back, increasing ventilation (running a fan or opening a window) and cleaning more regularly will usually avoid mold from recurring, or at least keep the mold to a minimum. We can offer you with extra services if you need them in addition to your restoration work, including plumbing, basic contracting, electrical, and a/c and heating.<p>
<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen for us in our living room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
