<p>Corrosion is a process, which converts refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and steady wear and tear of materials (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you combine electricity, oxygen, metal and water, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal parts normally begin wearing away immediately after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can operate normally for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How fast the rust procedure takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust triggered by a water spill.</p>
