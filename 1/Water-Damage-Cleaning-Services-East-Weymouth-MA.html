<p>Centrifugal Fans: Centrifugal fans are excellent for drying in tough to reach locations-- under sinks, baseboards, toe-kicks-- and are more suitable when drying under carpet and padding. Just like axial fans, centrifugal fans move air throughout wet surfaces, vaporizing moisture into the air. With the use of warm air from the centrifugal, the water vapor is taken in by the dehumidifier. In addition to axial fans, a sufficient variety of centrifugal fans are preferred.</p>

<p>Some air cleaners are developed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a known irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Research studies have actually revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing air-borne mold or surface mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health dangers would not be decreased till mold pollutants are gotten rid of through cleaning. Health experts, consisting of the Minnesota Department of Health, do not recommend using ozone to attend to mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
