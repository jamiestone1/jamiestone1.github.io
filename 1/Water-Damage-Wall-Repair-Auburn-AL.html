<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying considering that the leak began, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely respectful person.</p>
