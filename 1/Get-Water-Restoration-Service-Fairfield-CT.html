<h3>Flood Remediation in Fairfield Connecticut</h2>
<p>As the job advances and the environment is stabilized, products can be dried by managing the humidity, airflow, and energy (heat). Further into the drying, air motion must be re-directed and ensure good transfer of energy to the staying damp areas. The general requirement for humidity control and air flow can be lower than at the beginning of the job considering that there is considerably less wetness in materials being evaporated during the latter stage.</p>
<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days.
