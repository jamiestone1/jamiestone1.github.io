<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally harmful. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were very helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>Since the plaster drywall is porous and soluble in water, getting it damp can turn into a major headache. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place.
