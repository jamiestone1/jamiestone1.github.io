<h3>Fire Restoration Cleaning in Elk City</h3>
<p>Remove paneling, wallboard and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be a long-term health risk and need to be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
