It is very important to quickly manage the wetness in the air and use adequate airflow to dry the surface of materials to decrease water activity, hence reducing the potential for microbial growth.

There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air.

If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any changes.</p>
