<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. Juice three to 5 lemons and put over affected location. Let it sit for five minutes, and then clean it away with a wet towel. Similar to a few of the above approaches, you can utilize a toothbrush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Mold growths (nests) can develop within 24-48 hours, so it is essential to act right away if you have a water spill or leakage-- particularly if you live in a damp or hot climate.

<p>Some air cleaners are developed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a recognized irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Studies have shown that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at eliminating airborne mold or surface mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health dangers would not be lowered till mold impurities are eliminated through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise the use of ozone to deal with mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
