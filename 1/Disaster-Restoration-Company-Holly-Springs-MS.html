We concentrate on cleaning and fixing properties that have actually suffered fire damage and work toward safeguarding and protecting your residential or commercial property from further damage. Shop vacuums or the companies that just have carpet drying equipment can't avoid the water from harming the walls, under molding or baseboards.
