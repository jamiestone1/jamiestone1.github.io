These filters are evaluated and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size.

<h3>Dealing With Fire Damage Properly in Sahuarita</h3>
<p>Get rid of wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health hazard and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
