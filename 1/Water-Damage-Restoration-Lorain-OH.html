Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it just goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve browsing a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
