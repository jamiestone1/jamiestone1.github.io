<p>Water invasion into structures can be extremely damaging. We engaged a team of researchers at the University of Colorado once InstaScope was created. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged specialist on the biological aspects of air pollution, this group was designated to validate and evaluate the brand-new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to produce a brand-new mold-assessment system for industrial customers that, unlike any other approach or device, can deliver clinically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so instantly. So when you think about all the dangers of mold, InstaScope is an essential tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>

It also makes the taping and mudding work much easier to blend in with the rest of the area. For ceilings, spots that are 12 square inches or less can be kept in location with drywall clips. Anything bigger needs to be attached to the ceiling joists in order to safely hold the spot's weight in addition to any insulation above it.</p>
<p>Product Removal: Some materials will need to be eliminated prior to the start of the cleaning process. Typically, walls, cabinets, and ceilings near the source of the fire are beyond saving. In these cases, our professionals get rid of the products and deal with them. As soon as we confirm that all the non-salvageable products have been eliminated, we then begin the fire restoration and fire cleaning process.</p>
