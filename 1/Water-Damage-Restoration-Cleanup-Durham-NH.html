<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (often two times a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the method and likewise were very useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster.
