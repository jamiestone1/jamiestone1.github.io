<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
