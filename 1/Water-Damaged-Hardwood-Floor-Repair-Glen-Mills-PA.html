<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to five lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and then clean it away with a damp towel. Just like some of the above approaches, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the problem zone if you seem like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimum cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will include a little extra heft to the mold-removal process.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
