<h3>Drying Wet Carpet in Tonawanda New York</h2>

<p>Once standing water is removed, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has taken in (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature also, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying task back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any modifications.</p>
