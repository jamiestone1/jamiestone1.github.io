Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
