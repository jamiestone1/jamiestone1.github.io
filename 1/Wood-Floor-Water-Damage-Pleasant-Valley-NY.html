<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Pleasant Valley</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>
