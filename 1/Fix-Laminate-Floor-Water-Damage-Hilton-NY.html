<p>If your home has mold you must make certain it is it looked after as soon as you can.  Mold can spread out truly rapidly, and it is more than just black spots. As it grows, it can break down the "food" that supports it, which can be the wooden studs supporting your walls, the sheetrock itself, or any other organic, porous materials in your home. That can be bad news for your home, let alone for your health.<p>
