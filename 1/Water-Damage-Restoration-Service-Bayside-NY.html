<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. As discussed, fast air movement across damp surfaces of assemblies or products is a vital part of successfully and effectively drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or products. Fast air movement throughout the surface area of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface wetness gives way to decreasing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The constant and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for altering conditions.</p>
