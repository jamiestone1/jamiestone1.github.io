<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins.

When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have become polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne.
