When MacBook water damage has actually occurred, the liquid will likely make its method to the reasoning board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass parts. Frequently, the Mac will work for a couple of days after the spill and then stop working.
