<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not know is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Unfavorable air makers, equipped with HEPA (high efficiency particle air filters") need to be utilized to get rid of bacteria and other impurities from the air during restoration work. Standing water and bulk sewage should be drawn out with self-contained vacuum devices with proper waste holding tanks which should be gotten rid of appropriately. Hard surfaces that are affected should be cleaned up and sanitized. Soft structural products such as carpets, carpet pads, plaster wallboard must be eliminated and correctly disposed of. Any material that absorbs significant quantities of wetness and can not be effectively cleaned must be removed. When infected products have been removed, a 2nd application of sanitizers should be applied to all work surface areas.</p>
