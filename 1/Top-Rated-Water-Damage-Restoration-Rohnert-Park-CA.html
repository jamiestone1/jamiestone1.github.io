<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of property damage that a family or organisation can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>
