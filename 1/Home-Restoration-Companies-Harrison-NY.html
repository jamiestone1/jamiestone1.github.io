<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface area and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>After the water and wetness have been eliminated the next action to repair water damage is to clean and sanitize the affected locations. Flood water frequently brings sewage and other pollutants with it. These pollutants must be eliminated before final repair work are conducted.
