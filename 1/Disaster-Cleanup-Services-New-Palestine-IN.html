<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Search for visible mold development (it may look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold often appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or building products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Look for signs of moisture or water damage (water leakages, standing water, water spots, condensation, etc.).</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the plaster drywall is soluble and permeable in water, getting it wet can become a significant headache.

In the case where drywall does get wet and simply begins to droop prior to drying out, repairing it may just need pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
