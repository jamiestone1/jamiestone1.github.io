<h3>Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration in Henderson</h3>
<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health danger and must be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use just the tip of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
