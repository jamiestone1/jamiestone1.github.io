<p>Any building that has experienced water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold development. Use a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore security, and cover hands, arms and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of visible mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use business black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to decontaminate the moldy areas, in addition to any nearby locations. If you utilize bleach, make sure it will not stain the material or surface area. Place all sponges, devices and other materials used in cleaning in a heavy duty trash can, and if possible, eliminate the bag through a neighboring exit instead of the main home, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
