<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Juice three to 5 lemons and pour over affected area. Let it sit for five minutes, and after that wipe it away with a moist towel. Similar to a few of the above methods, you can use a tooth brush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For optimal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any meal or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surfaces as dry as possible, attempt to keep the home's relative humidity in between 20-40 percent in the Winter and less than 60 percent the remainder of the year. You can purchase gadgets to determine relative humidity at some home supply stores. Ventilation, air blood circulation near cold surfaces, dehumidification, and efforts to reduce the production of wetness in the home are all extremely important in managing high humidity that often triggers mold growth in our environment.</p>
