When you have time, retrieve books from the freezer and air- or fan-dry the pages. Mold can grow practically anywhere, but it normally grows in warm, damp or damp environments It can also often be found in drier environments that have bad ventilation or air circulation.<p>

The restoration team will also remove chemical and biological pollutants. Getting rid of smoke odors is achieved with devices such as foggers, ozone generators, and hydroxyl generators. Examining mold development includes more than just taking a look at what's noticeably growing on the walls or in a corner.
