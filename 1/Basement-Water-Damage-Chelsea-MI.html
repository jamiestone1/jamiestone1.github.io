<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
