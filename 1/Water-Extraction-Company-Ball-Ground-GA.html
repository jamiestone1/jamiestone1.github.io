<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be easier since it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not a professional, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, but it's well worth learning. Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the specialist will get rid of the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this point, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
