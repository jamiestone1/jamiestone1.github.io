<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a permanent health threat and should be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the suggestion of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
