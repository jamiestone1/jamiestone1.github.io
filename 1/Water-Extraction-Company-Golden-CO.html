<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. Experts have labeled Pennsylvania the center of an industrywide epidemic that has affected stretching suburban homes, starter homes, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties constructed with products other than stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were constructed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local firms. Some are 10 or 20 years old. Others are new.</p>

<p>Food sources for mold in structures consist of cellulose-based products such as wood, cardboard and the paper facing on drywall and organic matter such as soap, fabrics, and dust including skin cells. If a house has mold, the moisture might originate in the basement or crawl area, a dripping roof or a leak in plumbing pipelines. Insufficient ventilation may accelerate wetness buildup. Noticeable mold nests may form where ventilation is poorest and on border walls (due to the fact that they are nearest the dew point ).</p>
<p>Depending on the seriousness of your drywall water damage, it might not be essential to replace your drywall after a flood or leakage. In the level of the serious damage or damage covering a large section of a wall or ceiling, call a professional for help as there might be structural damage to your home. In addition, if you have water logged drywall or a continuous leak, it is very important that you take action before mold or mildew establish. Mold spores in the air can be very harmful to your health and unattended mold and mildew can trigger a lot more damage to the structure of your home.</p>
