<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
