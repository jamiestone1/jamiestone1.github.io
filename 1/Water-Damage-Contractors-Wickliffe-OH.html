What you might not understand is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against removing mold in the long run.

The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
