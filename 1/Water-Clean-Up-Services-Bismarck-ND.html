Mold replicate by methods of small spores. The spores resemble seeds, but undetectable to the naked eye, that float through the air and deposit on surface areas.

Part of our monitoring process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air.
