Always ensure the interior of the wall is dry before you seal it, or mold and mildew may become an issue later on.<p>

Warm air in between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is perfect, especially for the very first 36 to 2 days of drying and is the ideal temperature for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit help in the evaporation process. Extremely hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit impedes the dehumidifiers' effectiveness.<p>
