Utilizing bleach or other disinfectants on surface areas after mold removal might be required where individuals are thought to be susceptible to fungal infections (such as an individual with immune system problems). Must you decide to use bleach or another chemical, please read and thoroughly follow the label directions and danger statements (caution, warning, danger).

Second, on non-porous surfaces such as tile, bleach is no more effective at removing mold than a moist cloth and a mild cleaning agent, so we suggest the least poisonous choice.</p>
